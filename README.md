# Machine-Learning-Models-on-Urdu-Dataset

* Upload the attached Urdu Classification Dataset into Pandas.  
* Clean the data.  
* Build a tokenized list of words from the data.  
* Remove stop words, Lemmatizing and Stemming, remove words with less frequency(Outliers).  
* Feature Extraction.  
* Apply a Logistic Regression model using a feature extraction algorithm bag of words (CountVectorizer).  
* Apply a Logistic Regression model using feature extraction algorithm TfidfVectorizer.  
* Compare the output of each model above.  
* Apply SVM (support vector machine predictor) to bag of words (CountVectorizer) and compare the output with above.
